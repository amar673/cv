<h4><p>The version of the Bill that was passed in the Karnataka Assembly will now be made into an ordinance that will be sent for the Governor’s consent. “For various reasons, we did not table the Bill in the council so we decided to pass an ordinance since we have provisions in the Constitution to do so. In the coming days, we will table and have it passed in the council too. We cannot do it now since the session is not in motion,” Karnataka Law Minister JC Madhuswamy told reporters in Bengaluru.</h4></p>
